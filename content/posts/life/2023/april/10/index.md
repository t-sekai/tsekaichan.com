## Food

On Wednesday March 8, I arrived, for the first time, at Mo-mo paradise in Mira Mesa with Alan and Eric for all-you-can-eat shabu-shabu and sukiyaki. We all got very full and enjoyed the meal. Right after, we decided to go to the Meet Fresh that is also in Mira Mesa. Since Eric and I have to get back to campus for a contest in time, we ran to the bus station and took the bus to the Meet Fresh. Despite being full from lunch, we still finish the dessert.

## Coding Contest

Eric and I registered for the Triple C programming contest in the first- and second- year group. Right after Meet Fresh, we took a lyft and barely got back to campus in time for the contest. When we arrived at the contest area, we saw groups of students around a table getting ready to start the contest. From the students, we found a group of students who are also from the ICPC team. This made us worried, but we stayed positive and prepared for the contest.

After the contest begin, Eric and I separated the contest into two halves to work on it. The problems weren't too difficult, so we sped through most of the easier ones and got to the harder ones. To the end of the contest, we maintain a first place advantage, yet the other ICPC team followed closely behind us. Finally, the contest ended. We solved most of the problems, except for a few that we lost some test cases for. The second team was only 4 points below us!

At the awards ceremony, we discussed problem solutions with the other teams and received our awards and prize money $100. Eric and I laughed that we reinbursed our lunch money. :P
