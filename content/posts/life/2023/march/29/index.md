## Scholar Society Escape Room

On Sunday March 5 (3/5), I attended the delayed Scholar Society Escape Room that I signed up for a while ago. I met up with the other members on a car ride to Mission Beach at 9 in the morning. We arrived there early, so we grabbed some drinks at the Starbucks nearby to wait for the other group of members to arrive. The Belmont Park was right next by.

When everyone got to the escape room place (unfortunately, I have no pictures of), we separated into two groups to solve two escape rooms. I went with the same people on my ride on an escape room called Antidote. It was a fun puzzle to stop some dangerous disease from escaping a laboratory; the game was mostly on finding lock combinations. Luckily, we escaped in 43 minutes ad 46 seconds (the game lasts for an hour). It was a fun experience, and I got a cool wristband for attempting the escape room.

## Belmont Park

Since the other group is still in their 80 minutes game, so we decided to play at the Belmont Park right next by. Each of us bought 16 park tickets. We planned to go on two of the more popular rides: Giant Dipper Roller Coaster and Beach Blaster. We fist went to the roller coaster. It was a thrilling ride, except the seat were a bit too small, so my knees were hurting after the ride.

After the ride, we were going to the Beach Blaster place, where we found out that it was in maintainance. By that time, the other group arrived, and we decided to spend our remaining tickets on bumper cars. It was fun :)

## Broken Yolk Cafe

After the bumber cars, we decided it is lunch and should probably start heading back to school. A few members departed on their own. I went with the remaining members to lunch at the Broken Yolk Cafe in Pacific Beach. The food was delicious.

After getting lunch, we got back on the car and drove back to UCSD.

Currently, I am having spring break at home in Palo Alto, so I will do my best to update the blog. ✍(◔◡◔)
