## Coco Ichibanya

On Wednesday March 1 (3/1), I went to Convoy with Alan, the biggest fan of Coco Ichibanya, right after the LaTeX freshman seminar from Mayer Hall in Revelle. Instead of Lyft/Uber, we went on a MTS this time. We had to change lanes from UCSD to UTC, then UTC to Convoy. It took about 40 minutes to get there. It was worth it because we were eating at Coco that day.

I got the stewed beef omelet with vegetables, and it tasted too good. 10/10

##  (°ロ°) !

After we finished, we were set on our way to Marukai, a Japanese grocery store 15 minutes walking distance away. While we walked out of the restaurant, we were shocked to see the outside. Is that snow?

I have never seen or touched snow so close in my life, so I was very excited. I immediately grabbed some in my hands. The snow was light and cold, yet my heart was pounding with joy and excitement. I shaped it into different shapes like a child. I kept it with me for a few minutes before throwing it back to the ground. I called my parents about the incident; they claimed that it was snow, and jokingly told me that I don't have to go to the north to touch snow now.

After basically telling everyone about it, we arrived at Marukai and shopped for the things we need. We then returned back to UCSD on a Lyft after getting Boba.
