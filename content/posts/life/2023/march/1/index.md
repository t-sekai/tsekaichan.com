## Leaving UCSD

Four days ago (2/25), I participated in the ICPC Southern California Regionals at Riverside City College. **ICPC** stands for International Collegiate Programming Contest. It was my first time participating adn representing UCSD, so I was very excited. I was part of the second UCSD team: **UCSD Team 2**. My teammates were Shubham and Victor. 

Since network is prohibbited during the contest, I had to compute a reference sheet the night beforehand. I spent the whole night with the help of ChatGPT to compute my 24 page reference paper for Java (which Shubha m and I uses). [Here](icpc_ref.pdf). 

In the morning, I had to leave at 7:00 am to catch the Uber with my teams at 7:30. It was a raining and cold day. I held my umbrella tightly to avoid myself from the rain.

## Arriving Riverside City College and the Contest

I got on one of the three Uber XL with my team and team 5. The ride to Riverside was one and a half hours. Since I didn't eat any breakfast, I got kind of carsick on the way; somehow closing my eyes was helpful, so I slept halfway. When we got there, somehow my umbrella broke on the car, so when I got off, I had to put my hoodie on to avoid from getting wet.

We first checked in and got our tags and icpc shirts. We then head to the cafeteria for breakfast. There was already a few teams there, yet there wasn't a lot of food. Following the breastfast, we have an orientation going over some introductions and rules about the contest. Then, we had a session to test our programs in the computer lab. We didn't find any problems with coding the problems.

After the session, we had lunch from the food truck. I was served with a hamburger and fries. It was pretty delicious, except I was in the cold wind while eating it. Figuring it was too cold, I moved back to cafeteria. While I was there, I met with my brother's friend Rishi from UCLA.

Afte lunch, we started to prepare for the contest. I was nervous and excited, hoping to contribute to the team. When we started the contest, no electronics were allowed. We split the problem set and all worked our best on it. At the end, we finished six problems in total, where we each did two. We ended up at 15th place out of over 50 teams; although there is still space to improve, it was a good result for my first time participating. It was a surprised (or not really) that UCSD team 1 got first place in the contest.

## Closing Ceremony

Right after the contest ended, we went to get our pizza dinner at the cafeteria while listening to the results.

## Unexpected Ending

On the way back, we had trouble finding a Uber. We had to meet the Uber at the parking lot, which is when I see this:

There were a lot of rain that day. *I see why Riverside got its name. lol*

We took the Uber back, but we set the destination wrong. We ended up arriving at University of San Diego. We had to order another Uber back, but before that we kind of explored the campus a bit. University of San Diego really has a pretty campus. Maybe I will visit again next time.
