    overview: 'Team: Historic Metahuman'
  positions:
  - designation: Research and Development Intern
    start: April 2023
    end: Present
    responsibilities:
    - Co-developed interactive 3D avatars of historical figures in Unreal Engine 5, driven by large language models and end-to-end text-to-speech/face pipeline. Implemented speaker-tracking module for webcam and multi-player VR. The cyber-archeology project serves to preserve and educate cultural heritage.
    - Developed a dynamic real-time processing audio-to-face pipeline that receives input from text-to-speech, uses Audio2Face with Rest API to simulate facial movements from audio, and renders on a 3D avatar. Developed a multi-speaker tracking model to drive a Metahuman's attention and face/body motion using Google MediaPipe.
    - Researching lightweight, attention-based residual neural network models that process real-time text/audio/visual data to simulate personalized facial blendshapes and body/hand gestures for conversational Metahumans.
