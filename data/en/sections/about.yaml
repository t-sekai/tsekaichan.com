# a summary about you
summary: "Hi, I am Tse-kai (Kevin) Chan. I'm a second-year CS major and Regents Scholar at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I'm a motivated student interested in emerging and innovative technologies. Currently, I research RL/Robotics in Prof. Hao Su's Lab and work on AI/VR software at Qualcomm Institute. I have solid programming experience in Java and Python, and moderate experience in C++, JavaScript, and Kotlin. In my projects and internships, I have used Git, PyTorch, Docker, Unreal Engine, React.js, LaTeX, Simulink, etc., and have experience in research, deep learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision, and android/VR/web developments. Besides being a student, I'm a competitive programmer, researcher, developer, and innovator."
