      <description>Coco Ichibanya On Wednesday March 1 (3/1), I went to Convoy with Alan, the biggest fan of Coco Ichibanya, right after the LaTeX freshman seminar from Mayer Hall in Revelle. Instead of Lyft/Uber, we went on a MTS this time. We had to change lanes from UCSD to UTC, then UTC to Convoy. It took about 40 minutes to get there. It was worth it because we were eating at Coco that day.</description>
