      <description>Leaving UCSD Four days ago (2/25), I participated in the ICPC Southern California Regionals at Riverside City College. ICPC stands for International Collegiate Programming Contest. It was my first time participating adn representing UCSD, so I was very excited. I was part of the second UCSD team: UCSD Team 2. My teammates were Shubham and Victor.
Since network is prohibbited during the contest, I had to compute a reference sheet the night beforehand.</description>
