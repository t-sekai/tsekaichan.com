      <description>Coco Ichibanya On Wednesday March 1 (3/1), I went to Convoy with Alan, the biggest fan of Coco Ichibanya, right after the LaTeX freshman seminar from Mayer Hall in Revelle. Instead of Lyft/Uber, we went on a MTS this time. We had to change lanes from UCSD to UTC, then UTC to Convoy. It took about 40 minutes to get there. It was worth it because we were eating at Coco that day.</description>

      <description>Leaving UCSD Four days ago (2/25), I participated in the ICPC Southern California Regionals at Riverside City College. ICPC stands for International Collegiate Programming Contest. It was my first time participating adn representing UCSD, so I was very excited. I was part of the second UCSD team: UCSD Team 2. My teammates were Shubham and Victor.
Since network is prohibbited during the contest, I had to compute a reference sheet the night beforehand.</description>
