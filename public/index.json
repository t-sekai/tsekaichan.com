Instead of Lyft/Uber, we went on a MTS this time. We had to change lanes from UCSD to UTC, then UTC to Convoy. It took about 40 minutes to get there. It was worth it because we were eating at Coco that day.\nI got the stewed beef omelet with vegetables, and it tasted too good. 10/10\n(°ロ°) ! After we finished, we were set on our way to Marukai, a Japanese grocery store 15 minutes walking distance away. While we walked out of the restaurant, we were shocked to see the outside. Is that snow?\nI have never seen or touched snow so close in my life, so I was very excited. I immediately grabbed some in my hands. The snow was light and cold, yet my heart was pounding with joy and excitement. I shaped it into different shapes like a child. I kept it with me for a few minutes before throwing it back to the ground. I called my parents about the incident; they claimed that it was snow, and jokingly told me that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to go to the north to touch snow now.\nAfter basically telling everyone about it, we arrived at Marukai and shopped for the things we need. We then returned back to UCSD on a Lyft after getting Boba.\n","date":"March 14, 2023","hero":"/posts/life/2023/march/14/images/image6.jpg","permalink":"https://t-sekai.github.io/posts/life/2023/march/14/","summary":"Coco Ichibanya On Wednesday March 1 (3/1), I went to Convoy with Alan, the biggest fan of Coco Ichibanya, right after the LaTeX freshman seminar from Mayer Hall in Revelle.

ICPC stands for International Collegiate Programming Contest. It was my first time participating adn representing UCSD, so I was very excited. I was part of the second UCSD team: UCSD Team 2. My teammates were Shubham and Victor.\nSince network is prohibbited during the contest, I had to compute a reference sheet the night beforehand. I spent the whole night with the help of ChatGPT to compute my 24 page reference paper for Java (which Shubha m and I uses). Here.\nIn the morning, I had to leave at 7:00 am to catch the Uber with my teams at 7:30. It was a raining and cold day. I held my umbrella tightly to avoid myself from the rain.\nArriving Riverside City College and the Contest I got on one of the three Uber XL with my team and team 5. The ride to Riverside was one and a half hours. Since I didn\u0026rsquo;t eat any breakfast, I got kind of carsick on the way; somehow closing my eyes was helpful, so I slept halfway. When we got there, somehow my umbrella broke on the car, so when I got off, I had to put my hoodie on to avoid from getting wet.\nWe first checked in and got our tags and icpc shirts. We then head to the cafeteria for breakfast. There was already a few teams there, yet there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a lot of food. Following the breastfast, we have an orientation going over some introductions and rules about the contest. Then, we had a session to test our programs in the computer lab. We didn\u0026rsquo;t find any problems with coding the problems.\nAfter the session, we had lunch from the food truck. I was served with a hamburger and fries. It was pretty delicious, except I was in the cold wind while eating it. Figuring it was too cold, I moved back to cafeteria. While I was there, I met with my brother\u0026rsquo;s friend Rishi from UCLA.\nAfte lunch, we started to prepare for the contest. I was nervous and excited, hoping to contribute to the team. When we started the contest, no electronics were allowed. We split the problem set and all worked our best on it. At the end, we finished six problems in total, where we each did two. We ended up at 15th place out of over 50 teams; although there is still space to improve, it was a good result for my first time participating. It was a surprised (or not really) that UCSD team 1 got first place in the contest.\nClosing Ceremony Right after the contest ended, we went to get our pizza dinner at the cafeteria while listening to the results.\nHere, are some other photos we took at the scene.\nUnexpected Ending On the way back, we had trouble finding a Uber. We had to meet the Uber at the parking lot, which is when I see this:\nThere were a lot of rain that day. I see why Riverside got its name. lol\nWe took the Uber back, but we set the destination wrong. We ended up arriving at University of San Diego. We had to order another Uber back, but before that we kind of explored the campus a bit. University of San Diego really has a pretty campus. Maybe I will visit again next time.\nThis blog also took unnecessary long to finish. Started on March 1, and finally finished the English version on March 9.\n","date":"March 1, 2023","hero":"/posts/life/2023/march/1/images/tag.jpg","permalink":"https://t-sekai.github.io/posts/life/2023/march/1/","summary":"Leaving UCSD Four days ago (2/25), I participated in the ICPC Southern California Regionals at Riverside City College.
